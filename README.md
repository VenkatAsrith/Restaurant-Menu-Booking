Restaurant Menu & Table Reservation Web Application

A modern full-stack web application designed to digitize the restaurant experience by allowing users to explore the menu and book tables online. This project simplifies the reservation process for customers while providing a clean and responsive user interface backed by a scalable backend API.

📖 Project Description

This application enables users to make table reservations at a restaurant through an intuitive web interface. Instead of traditional phone-based or walk-in bookings, customers can choose their preferred date and time, enter their details, and submit a reservation request instantly.

The project demonstrates a complete frontend–backend integration, focusing on REST API communication, form handling, data validation, and database connectivity. It is ideal as a real-world full-stack project and portfolio showcase.
